      Memory
    </h1>
    <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p> 
      This is going to be a long post and, if you are experienced, a boring one.
      I will try to make this the introduction to memory that i wanted to have
      when i began developing software. This post is neither academic nor for the
      market. This is just the best mental model that i found to work on software
      effectivlly and not get stuck on silly things.
    </p>
    <h2> For who </h2>
    <p> 
      For almost everyone, i will explain most of the things very thoroughly but i
      expect at least some experience in any programing language, most of the 
      syntax and the technicalities will be explained however, if you do not have
      any experience most of the concepts will be hard to grasp.
    </p>
    <h2> I DONT WANNA READ</h2>

    <h2>Everything is bytes</h2>
    <p> 
      Let's start from the basics

      everything is just memory and conventions around memory, from operating systems 
      to pictures, from executables to data tranfer protocols. Everything is just bytes
      arranged in a certain way, and our jobs as programs is to manipulate that memory
      in the way we want.
