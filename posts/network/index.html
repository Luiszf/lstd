    <h2> The Site </h2>
    <p> 
      this site was made with just html and css, no html generators, no .md files, just plain old html and css. 
      why? because i tried to get some serious writing going, but i was always stuck trying to make the site
      better instead of writing on it. i tried everything 
      <a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mdx">Nextjs</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://zine-ssg.io/">Zine</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/">Astro</a>.
      they all work great (i wouldn't use next js tho, kinda overkill), but they all had some features that i
      thought where missing and the feeling of having something almost perfect bothered me to the point that
      i would not write anything for weeks. I was to focused on trying to build a system instead of actually
      writing, so how i solved my problem? having no system at all. I probably need to use a manual screwdriver
      to apreciate a eletric one.
