    <h2> The Site </h2>
    <p> 
      this site was made with just html and css, no html generators, no .md files, just plain old html and css. 
      why? because i tried to get some serious writing going, but i was always stuck trying to make the site
      better instead of writing on it. i tried everything 
      <a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/mdx">Nextjs</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://zine-ssg.io/">Zine</a>,
      <a class="link" href="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/">Astro</a>.
      they all work great (i wouldn't use next js tho, kinda overkill), but they all had some features that i
      thought where missing and the feeling of having something almost perfect bothered me to the point that
      i would not write anything for weeks. I was to focused on trying to build a system instead of actually
      writing, so how i solved my problem? having no system at all. I probably need to use a manual screwdriver
      to apreciate a eletric one.

    <h2> The Posts </h2>
    <p>
      most of the posts in here in going to be about some software tech i am working on and i am quite ecletic
      in that aspect so many subjects will be aborded. All of the posts and working drafts will be in the github
      repository, the only diference between drafts and posts is that drafts will not be listed in the home page.
    </p>
    <p>
      i will do the search to the best of my ability, but i will be wrong many times, so please if you see anything
      factually incorrect make an issue on github.
    </p>
    <p>
      i will also make some posts in portuguese, they will not be one to one translation of the other, there are
      topics that only make sense in Brasil and vice versa. But if a post is high effort i will try my best to 
      bring to the two languages.
    </p>
    <h2> Why </h2>
    <p>
      i think about tech a lot and i needed a place to put my thoughts in. I could just made some notes, i did that
      for a while, but i wanted to do something less individual. now if i want to participate in some discursion i will
      make a post about it and link it, and in that way, feel more close to the tech comunity as a hole. And if someday
      one post of mine help someone, i will be very glad.
    </p>


    <h2> The Author</h2>
    <p>
      i am from Brasil and i have been studying software development since 2020. Most of the things online about the
      area was stuff like "become a frontend developer in 6 months" with rushed and incomplete information. I didn't
      like this at all, so i studied by myself trying to understand things more deeply. trying to get my computer 
      science degree going, build cool stuff. And is pretty much it.
